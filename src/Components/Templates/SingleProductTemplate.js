					Its 6 am on a balmy day. Fresh decoction goes drip-drip in Paatiâ€™s brass filter and the aroma of coffee wafts through our home. Paati gives
					VS Thatha his first frothy cup and prepares a tall flask for the entire household. Her coffee-chicory blend is perfect - strong and
					flavorful, with no bitter aftertaste. Our mornings are punctuated by frequent doses from this beloved coffee flask. Now, we bring you our
					homebrew in a ready-to-consume format. Simply mix with hot milk and sugar, and savour the rich flavours of the coffee we grew up relishing!
					With love, from our home to yours.
